The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest forms of encryption named after Julius Caesar who
used the method to disguise military messages. A string of text is encrypted by shifting the
alphabet by a number of letters, the key, and substituting the letters in the message for the
corresponding letters of the transformed alphabet. Decrypting the message involves a reversal
of this process but hacking it without knowing the key becomes rather complex and ambiguous
as words may exist in all possible cases.

**Goal:** Create a program that allows the user to encrypt and decrypt a message in addition to
hacking an encrypted message of an unknown key. Allow for testing of the hacking algorithm and export data to an excel file.
