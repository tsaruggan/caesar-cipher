### Problem <a name = "PROBLEM"></a>
The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest forms of encryption named after Julius Caesar who
used the method to disguise military messages. A string of text is encrypted by shifting the
alphabet by a number of letters, the key, and substituting the letters in the message for the
corresponding letters of the transformed alphabet. Decrypting the message involves a reversal
of this process but hacking it without knowing the key becomes rather complex and ambiguous
as words may exist in all possible cases.

**Goal:** Create a program that allows the user to encrypt and decrypt a message in addition to
hacking an encrypted message of an unknown key. Allow for testing of the hacking algorithm and export data to an excel file.

**Analysis:**  
The problem can be broken down into three parts, encryption/decryption, hacking and testing.

*Encryption/Decryption*
- How can I use a loops and arrays to shift the alphabet by a key?
- What is the easiest way to compare letters in the message to corresponding alphabet?
- How do I avoid IndexOutOfBounds errors when checking each letter?
- Is decryption method the same as encryption but switching alphabet?
- Is it possible to add spaces between the words in the decrypted message?

*Hacking*
- How do I check if a string contains a word?
- Is it necessary to check all possible cases?
- How do I assess the correct solution if multiple cases contain words?

*Testing*
- How do I read from a .txt file?
- What library allows to format and export data into an Excel file?
- How to check if hacking successfully decrypted the unknown message?  

### Algorithm <a name = "ALGORITHM"></a>  
**Shift:**  
The shift function involves first taking the key parameter and ensuring it is within range of 0-26. A
negative shift is equivalent to a positive shift by adding 26 whereas a large number shift can be simplified
by dividing by 26 and finding the remainder. The shift algorithm uses a for-loop to assign values to the
global array holding the shifted alphabet; the key is used as a marker for the current position in the
original alphabet and when it reaches the end, the marker is reset to 0, ‚ÄòA‚Äô and continues.  

```C#
            // if key shifts alphabet one or more times, simplify to shift less than 26 char
            if (key > 26 || key < -26) { key = key % 26; }

            // if key is negative, simplify to positive
            if (key < 0) { key = 26 + key; }

            int current = key; // current is index of the starting char wanted for new alphabet
            for (int i = 0; i < alphabet.Length; i++)
            {
                shiftedAlphabet[i] = alphabet[current]; // set characters for new alphabet
                current++;
                if (current > 25) { current = 0; }// if end of alphabet is reached, reset index back to 'A'
            }
```  
**Encryption/Decryption:**  
Encrypting the message is rather simple but first requires the message to be cleaned of non-letter
characters and converted to capital letters. After the shift method is called, the encryption function uses a
for-loop to first take each letter in the message and find its index in the original alphabet. Next, the letter in
the shifted alphabet of corresponding index is appended to the encrypted message.  

```C#  
            String encryptedMsg = ""; // initialize encrypted message
            message = Regex.Replace(message, "[^a-zA-Z]", "").ToUpper();  // remove all non letter characters from string +  make upper case
            shift(key); // applies shift to alphabet by given key

            // for each letter in message, swap with corresponding letter in new alphabet
            for (int x = 0; x < (message.Length); x++)
            {
                int index = 0; // index value of original alphabet
                bool check = false;

                // loops until the index of the letter in original alpha is found for single letter in message
                while (!check)
                {
                    String currentLetter = message[x].ToString(); // hold current letter of message
                    if (string.Compare(currentLetter, alphabet[index]) == 0)
                    { // compare if letter in message matches letter in alpha of current index
                        check = true; // if found, break loop
                        encryptedMsg = encryptedMsg + shiftedAlphabet[index]; // add the letter from the corresponding index of new alpha
                    }
                    else
                    {
                        index++; // if not found, add to index and check again
                    }
                }
            }
            return encryptedMsg;  
```  
The decryption method follows the same routine except the roles of the original alphabet array and the
shifted alphabet array are swapped. The loop takes a letter in the message and finds its index in the
shifted alphabet then appends the corresponding letter from the original alphabet to the decrypted
message.  

**Hacking:**  
Hacking an encrypted message involves checking each of the 26 possible decrypted cases and
assessing the most probable message. The hacking method applies a nested loop to first decrypt each
case and then comb through the a text file containing a word list of 58,000 + words and see if the message contains each
word and award points based on the length of the containing word.  

```C#  
            String hackedMsg = ""; // initialize hacked message
            int topMatches = 0; // the most words found within a decrypted message

            // for each possible message, check the number of real words exist it contains and compare
            for (int key = 0; key < 26; key++)
            {
                int matches = 0; // number of match points for current decrypted message
                try
                {
                    System.IO.StreamReader file = new System.IO.StreamReader(Path.Combine(Environment.CurrentDirectory, wordListFileName));
                    String word; // read from file of over 58 000 english words

                    // loop for every word in .txt file
                    while ((word = file.ReadLine()) != null)
                    {
                        // check if decrypted msg contains word
                        if (decrypt(encryptedMsg, key).Contains(word)) { matches += word.Length; } // if word exists, award match points depending on length of matching word  
                    }

                    if (matches > topMatches)
                    { // if word has most match points, becomes the most probable message
                        topMatches = matches;
                        hackedMsg = decrypt(encryptedMsg, key); // set hacked message to word with top matche points
                    }

                }
                catch (System.IO.FileNotFoundException)  
```  
The message with the most matches is returned as the most probable message. Each of the 26 cases
performs over 58 000 evaluations resulting in a total over 1.5 million evaluations making the software
somewhat slow.
